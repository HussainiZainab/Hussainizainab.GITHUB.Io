    <h1>June 11 2018</h1>
    <h3>Today we learned the basics structure of code and website, we add pictures and navigation bar in our website. We made a poster for the class. We also made a GITHUB accout to publish our codes publicly.</h3>
	<h1> June 12 2018 </h1>
	<h3> Today I learned, how to publish my website, learned about internet and how it is made. Further more learned about ICP/IP Model.We also add new slides for our website, and published them publicly on GITHUB. I also made a conatct form for my website.
	<h1>June 13 2018</h1>
	<h3>Today we learned about cyber security and different types of it. The difference between a black hat hacker and white hat hacker. Also we learned about Java Script, and included some of the funtions into our html files as shown below:
<button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='fullstar.png'">Turn on the light</button>

<h1>June 22 2018 Robotics </h1>
<h3>
Today we finished putting every piece of the robot. We copied the code from Diana's repository and paste it into the Arduino.When we uploaded the code into the robort, it was working correctly, it was going straight and was moving, as it was supposed to do, but when we start changing functions in the code, it start causing problem. It was not going straight and the right tire was too strong than the left tire. Therefore, it was going staright for 2 sec and than it would start going backwards and than in circle. We tried to chnage the variables for the tire functions, but it never worked. The right tire was stronger, even though we equaled both the tires variables. Today I learned on how to make a robot. I learned how to put each piece of the robot togather and how to make it work. I also learned on how to add functions and change variables to make the robot work properly.

<h1> Circuit </h1>
 <h3>We also learned to make a circuit and learned about 3 main types of electronics which are current, voltage and resistance. We also learned series and parallel ciruits, and we actually build it. First we did it from a picture and later we made one ourselves individually a ciruit. </h3>

 <h1> Python </h1>
 <h3>In pyhton we learned to make social network. We learned to add various features into our social networking project such as i out create posts, unfriend, add friend, removed friend, add comment, made a funtion for first name, last name, and we made 2 friends. </h3>
 <h1>AI Intelligence and google assistant</h1>
 <h3>In AI Intelligence, we learned about different types of robotic technologies such as self driving car, a chatbox,a hand that catches something that is throwed on it. We also reviewed all of them. We also finished our individual google assistant and took screenshoot of them and paste it into our coding portfolio. Later we watched a couple of videos about neural system and tried to code it. We made a new file and coded them. We tried to do another layer in which two buttons works at one time, but was not able to do it.</h3>
 <h3>Some of the picture of the google assistant conversation</h3>
